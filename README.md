# hello-world
=============================
Hi, learning to code full-time as of December 2015. Focusing on JavaScript (as well as HTML5 and CSS3). From London, UK. 
Just playing around figuring out how to use this GitHub account.
Message me if you are doing a similar thing and live in London.
Not even sure if there is a message area to GitHub yet....
